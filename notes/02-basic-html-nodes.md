# Basic HTML Nodes

Let's cover the _basic_ html nodes (eg. ones that don't require attributes).

- *Head:* Holds metadata (eg. title)
- *Body:* Holds all the content that you'll see.
- *H1 -> H6:* Headers of different size.
- *Paragraph:* One way to store longform text.
- *Div:* A division - the most common HTML node, it's used to structure just about every webpage.
- *Breaks:* 
- *Bold:*
